Student Information & Grade Management System
🚀 Overview

This repository contains a robust C++ implementation of an academic management system designed to process complex student data records. Moving beyond simple variables, this project utilizes Object-Oriented principles and Standard Template Library (STL) containers to manage academic performance across multiple courses.

🛠 Engineering Highlights

Custom Data Structures: Implemented a Courses struct with a custom constructor to encapsulate course names and letter grades into single, manageable objects.

Operator Overloading: Overloaded the << operator to allow for direct, clean output of custom objects to the standard stream.

Dynamic Data Management: Utilized std::vector to handle a collection of course details, demonstrating an understanding of dynamic memory and array-like containers.

Complex Logic Flow: Features a comprehensive grading engine that evaluates numerical percentages against strict academic thresholds to assign final grades.

Modular Calculation: Decouples CA totals and sessional grade logic into independent functions for better testability and maintenance.

💻 Technical Stack

Language: C++

Core Concepts: Structs, STL Vectors, Operator Overloading, and Functional Programming.

Environment: Developed in Xcode on macOS, ensuring high-performance compilation and POSIX compliance.
